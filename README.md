## About Me
My name is Adam and I normally code using vscode and code in c++, sadly I don't have a good pc to run unreal engine which, I want to be a game dev, so I will be buying a new pc.

# Background

I first started coding when I was 7, I used scratch to code, I watch the platformer griffpatch tutorial, I failed at episode 4 (Slopes & Limbs Posing), Oh yeah my scratch username.... was SadMan67819, sadly this account is deleted, I made another account called.... XxBlackInWhitexX................................... My account is still up https://scratch.mit.edu/users/XxBlackInWhitexX/. Don't let the date fool you the account wasnt made 11 months ago, it was made 3 years ago, I don't know why it shows 11 months. Now at 8, I started to code with text-based languages and what I wanted to learn was C++, But I couldn't learn all of it cause the tutorial I used didn't cover all of C++. When I learn't C++ I got bored and for eid I got a arduino, I downloaded Arduino IDE on my pc and followed the pdf tutorial that came with it. Then I got bored of that when I was 10, so I made a calculator in JS of course.. https://calalculator.netlify.app, subtracting didn't work... "Evidence Jood" is there cuz I wanted to show my best friend that I made this website, and his name is Jood. and that's it. Now my main language I code in is C++
